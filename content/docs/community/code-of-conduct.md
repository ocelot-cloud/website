We are committed to a professional, productive, and welcoming environment for everyone involved in this project - contributors, maintainers, and users alike.

### Expected Behavior

* Act with courtesy, respect, and empathy. 
* Foster an inclusive atmosphere that values diverse perspectives. 
* Offer constructive, actionable feedback oriented toward improving the project. 
* Collaborate in good faith.

### Unacceptable Behavior

* Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks. 
* Derogatory, inflammatory, or otherwise abusive language. 
* Sustained disruption of discussions or workflows.

### Enforcement

Violations will result in consequences proportionate to the severity and frequency of the behavior, ranging from a warning to temporary or permanent removal from project spaces.

### Interaction with the Maintainers

Our maintainers give generously of their time and expertise to keep this project moving forward. Because their availability is limited, we ask that all interactions respect their time. Before contacting the maintainers, for example, by opening issues, please make sure you've first done your part:

* Check to see if your topic is already covered in the documentation, existing GitHub issues, discussions, and community forums.
* If there is someone in the community who can help you, ask your questions in the appropriate forums before contacting the maintainers.
* Help reduce the maintainer's workload whenever possible by doing things yourself.

When you do reach out:

* Communicate clearly, concisely, and factually.
* Avoid vague questions or unstructured requests; ensure your message is actionable.
* Bug reports, well-argued proposals, etc. that benefit the project are of course welcome.

Be patient, responses may take some time. If the request is poorly worded or lacks context, it may be ignored.
