### Improve Documentation

The content of this website/documentation server is publicly available at {{< external_link "https://github.com/ocelot-cloud/docs" "GitHub" >}}. If you find a typo, missing information, or have suggestions for improvement, ideally submit a PR with your changes, or second best, write your proposed, **fully formulated** changes in the issue. The links at the top of the right navigation bar can help you.

The goal is for the docs to contain all the necessary information, but in a concise manner. So if you see a gap in information, common questions not answered in the docs, duplication or just text improvements you are encouraged to point it out or even fix it. We recommend using supportive tools such as {{< external_link "https://www.deepl.com/write" "DeepL" >}} or {{< external_link "https://chatgpt.com/" "ChatGPT" >}} to help with writing.

### Report bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub with a clear title and detailed description. Include the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected result, and the actual result. Include screenshots or logs if possible. Label the issue as "bug".

### Contribute Code

Fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and then submit a pull request (PR). All code contributions should pass existing tests and include new tests for added features.

Ideas for contributions include:

* Code refactoring, simplification and deduplication
* Solving open issues like bug fixes
* Security audits or implementing additional security measures
* Adding missing tests for stability
* Integration features for
  * apps, since they are quite individual in terms of installation and configuration.
  * third-party services

You can also discuss ideas in the community forums.

### Expand the App Store

If you have software with a web interface that you would like to share with the community, you can simply package it as an app and upload it. If an app becomes popular, we will consider adopting it as an official app.

### Spread the Word

Help spread awareness of the project on social media. Encourage others to share and use it.
