title: "EULA Simplified Overview"
---

This quick summary helps you understand the main points of our EULA but is not legally binding. The full EULA always takes precedence if there's any conflict.

- **Freedom of Use**: Ocelot-Cloud can be used for any purpose. We reserve the right to charge for premium features, while you retain full control over how and where you deploy it. You may charge for installation on customer hardware and sell or buy Ocelot-Cloud as a SaaS product. The execution of the software is entirely up to you.
- **Data Collection**: We may collect personal information and device information to ensure license verification and compliance when using premium features, but we try to keep this to a minimum.
- **Prohibited Actions**: Don’t break security, distribute viruses, misrepresent content, or try to bypass license/feature restrictions.
- **User Responsibility**: You assume all risks when downloading or uploading content. If you host Ocelot-Cloud for others, you must comply with all relevant privacy laws.
- **Warranty & Liability**: Ocelot-Cloud is provided “as is,” with no warranties. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable for any damages arising from the use or misuse of Ocelot-Cloud or third party content.
- **App Store Content**: Anything uploaded is automatically made available under the [0BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd). We don’t moderate user-uploaded content. Use of third party content is at your own risk.
