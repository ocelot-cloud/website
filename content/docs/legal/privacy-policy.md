This website does not collect, store, or process any personal data, such as IP addresses. We keep a minimal, anonymised access log for operational reasons. Each entry records only:

* Request line (HTTP method, path, and version)
* Status code
* Response size
* Request ID or sequence (just a counter)
* Internal router/service name
* Response time

Sample log entry:

```text
- - - [15/Jun/2025:19:34:22 +0000] "GET /docs/contact/ HTTP/2.0" 200 28212 "-" "-" 271 "website@docker" "-" 3ms
```

No visitor can be identified. These logs help us to diagnose errors, protect the service and measure aggregate traffic, such as which pages are visited the most. 

All statistics are produced from the anonymised log and are publicly available {{<external_link "https://stats.ocelot-cloud.org/" "here" >}}. We do not use cookies, fingerprinting, or third-party analytics.

This site contains links to external websites that we do not operate. Please review their privacy policies separately.
