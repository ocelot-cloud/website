When you first visit Mattermost after installation, follow the setup wizard to create the admin account.

### Disabling Self-Registration

By default, users can invite others to the Mattermost server. To restrict this so only admins can invite:

- Tile menu (top left) → System Console → User Management → Permissions → Edit Scheme → disable 'Add Team Members' → Save

### User Creation

Users are added by sending them an invitation link, which they use to create their own account. You can generate an invitation link using one of the following methods:

- Organization name (below the tile menu, top left) → Invite People → Invite Link → Copy Link
- Left sidebar → Direct Messages → Invite People → Invite Link → Copy Link
