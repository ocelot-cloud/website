When you first visit Mattermost after installation, follow the setup wizard to create the admin account.

### Disabling Self-Registration

By default, users can invite others to the Mattermost server. To restrict this so only admins can invite:

- Tile menu (top left) → System Console → User Management → Permissions → Edit Scheme → disable **Add Team Members** → Save

This ensures only admins can invite users.

### User Creation

Users are added by sending them an invitation link, which they use to create their own account. To generate an invitation link:

- Organization name (below the tile menu, top left) → Invite People → Invite Link → Copy Link  
  or
- Left sidebar → Direct Messages → Invite People → Invite Link → Copy Link
