By default, when you create a backup of an app, Ocelot-Cloud will create a local backup of it. However, if remote backups are enabled, an additional remote backup is created and sent to an external SSH server.

We strongly recommend that you enable this feature. If your hard drive becomes irreversibly damaged, remote backup may be the only way to recover your data.

Ocelot-Cloud uses the **restic** tool in the backend, which provides end-to-end encryption. This means that even if someone intercepts the traffic or gains access to the backup server, they cannot read your encrypted backup data.

{{< alert title="Note" color="warning" >}}
Always keep a copy of your settings, especially the Restic encryption password. Without it, your backup data cannot be restored in case of irreversible hard drive damage.

## Usage Guide

1. On the Ocelot-Cloud Settings > Remote Backup page, fill in all required fields except **SSH Known Hosts**. The **Remote Host** can be either a domain or an IP address.
1. Click the **GET KNOWN HOSTS** button. This uses the **Remote Host** and **SSH Port** to fetch the backup serverâ€™s public SSH keys. The **SSH Known Hosts** field will then be populated with the public SSH keys of the backup server.
1. Verify that the received keys match those of the actual server. You can do this by running `ssh-keyscan -p <port> -H <host>` from a separate trusted machine and comparing the output. For all future connections, only servers matching the keys in **SSH Known Hosts** will be trusted. This protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
1. Click the **TEST CONNECTION** button. If it fails, review your settings. If successful, it confirms that Ocelot-Cloud can connect to the remote server for backups.
1. Check the **Enable Remote Repository** option and click **SAVE** to activate remote backups.
1. Test: Create a backup of an app and check out on the Backups page to see that a remote backup of that app has been created.
