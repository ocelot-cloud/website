Ocelot-Cloud only takes care of the system administration. The actual day-to-day functionality like chat or data cloud comes from the installed apps.

### App Store

Digital infrastructure can be installed as apps, much like a smartphone. An app store simplifies the process of discovering and installing new apps, while allowing anyone to upload their own apps.

### List of Official Apps

These are the apps of the official maintainer **ocelotcloud** available in the App Store.

| App | Description |

We are working on adding more official apps to the App Store.

### Unofficial Apps

Any third party can upload apps to the App Store, which any user can then download. To visit them, install Ocelot-Cloud and explore the App Store page there.
