Ocelot-Cloud simplifies digital infrastructure management. Its mission, however, extends beyond technology. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuFlMtZmvY0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short video</a> highlights the scientific reasons we struggle with today’s digital world.

### Problem 1: Human Limits

Our brains evolved for small, close-knit groups where people share culture and see each other daily. Modern social media, however, forces us into a global sphere of unfamiliar faces and conflicting views, causing stress, mistrust, and division.

### Problem 2: Concentrated Power
A few giant tech corporations dominate online spaces, especially social media. Their power can be abused to exploit user data, manipulate opinions, and influence elections.

### Solution: Digital Villages

Digital Villages are small communities built around shared interests: neighborhoods, hobbies, causes, or professions. Ocelot-Cloud makes it easy to host these on a single server, covering forums, data storage, and more. The approach is decentralized, offering:

* **Smaller, trusted groups** that reduce stress and promote camaraderie.
* **Reputation-based systems** that foster accountability and constructive norms.
* **No commercial tracking**, no addictive design, no destructive content promotion.
* **Local autonomy**, with each village setting its own culture and rules.
* **Resilience** against single points of control or censorship.
