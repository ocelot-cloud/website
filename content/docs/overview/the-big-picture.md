Ocelot-Cloud simplifies digital infrastructure management. Its mission, however, extends beyond technology. This {{< external_link "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuFlMtZmvY0" "video" >}} highlights the scientific reasons we struggle with today’s digital world.

### Problem 1: Human Limits

Our brains evolved for small, close-knit groups where people share culture and see each other frequently. Modern social media, however, forces us into a global sphere of unfamiliar faces and conflicting views, causing stress, mistrust, and division.

### Problem 2: Concentrated Power

Today’s online spaces are dominated by a handful of tech giants. Driven by profit, they harvest personal data, control the flow of information, and influence public opinion — even elections. Their size also makes them vulnerable to state pressure, enabling governments to impose surveillance and censorship. 

### Solution: Digital Villages

Digital Villages are small, cohesive communities built around shared interests: neighborhoods, hobbies, causes, or professions. Ocelot-Cloud makes it easy to found a Digital Village by hosting it on a server. It's apps cover forums, data storage, and more services for organization and interaction. The approach is decentralized, offering:

* **Smaller, trusted groups** that reduce stress and promote camaraderie.
* **Reputation-based systems** that foster accountability and constructive norms.
* **No commercial** tracking, no addictive design, no destructive content promotion.
* **Local autonomy**, with each village setting its own culture and rules.
* **Resilience** against single points of control or censorship.
* **Decentralization** makes it far more difficult for state actors to achieve control.

Digital Villages are not a replacement for real-world social connections, but an intentional alternative to the noise and manipulation of mainstream social media.
