Citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) rely on digital infrastructure, such as servers for data storage, messaging and video calling. However, none of the existing options for acquiring such infrastructure meets all of the following needs:

* privacy
* convenience
* long-term security
* option for customization

Let's look at some typical approaches, why they fall short, and what a better solution looks like.

### Option 1: External Cloud Services

Although outsourcing to an external cloud offers the convenience of taking over server management and adopting a pay-as-you-go model, there are serious trade-offs.

* Unpredictable terms and conditions: sudden price increases, feature removals, even bankruptcy
* Vendor lock-in: migrating data from one vendor to another can be slow, costly and technically challenging
* Opaque infrastructure: data resides in unknown locations and may be subject to unauthorized inspection
* Limited freedom: cloud services are closed off to users, which limits customization and integration

**Takeaway: To maintain control of our data, we need self-hosted infrastructure.**

### Option 2: Do-It-Yourself Hosting

Although setting up and running your own digital infrastructure gives you full control, it requires in-depth system administration expertise and knowledge of each installed piece of software and its specifics. It also requires constant updating and backups, which are typically out of reach for most individuals and SMEs.

**Takeaway: Automation must replace manual maintenance.**

### Option 3: Proprietary Self-Hosting Suites

There are proprietary solutions, i.e. solutions whose source code is not open. These solutions bring back the same problems as those encountered with cloud providers, such as vendor lock-in and a lack of customization.

**Takeaway: Freedom and long-term security requires open-source.**
